## New project

For each new project, you must create a new repository, choosing this one (w-boilerplate) as the repository template. Then, you can clone your repository on your computer.

## Installation

You need to install the dependencies use in this template. You can see the dependencies use in [package.json](https://github.com/mathieudaix/w-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json). If you need to use other dependencies, install them with the command line.

```shell script
# Install the dependencies
npm i

# Install new dependencies
npm i gsap
```

## Usage

```shell script
# Run the development server (open a new page with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build productions files (update the dist folder)
npm run prod 
```
